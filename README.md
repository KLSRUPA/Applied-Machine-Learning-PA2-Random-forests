## PA2 Title: Random Forests

 ### Description:
In this group assignment, I continued my exploration of tree-based models, focusing on random forests. We worked with the Adult dataset to predict income levels using both numerical and categorical features, which were encoded using one-hot encoding. Our tasks included encoding features, building a pipeline with scikit-learn, and analyzing the performance of decision tree and random forest classifiers to understand underfitting and overfitting. We also examined feature importances to interpret model predictions. This project enhanced my skills in machine learning workflows, data preprocessing, and ensemble methods.
